# Description: This repository is to do a set of projects from Free Code Camp to help me just delve into the unknown in coding. Currently have experience solving problems, but want to start delving into harder concepts, and I felt that this would be something to get my feet wetter, along with building a portfolio of material I have experience with, and experience with fundamentals will pay dividends later. 
# To any who are interested, please enjoy, and I hope to learn a bit going through this!
#To the flip-side where I finished this project, I have completed them and they run well, I will put "gg ez" at the end of this README
